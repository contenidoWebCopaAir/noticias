	Copa Airlines {NYSE: CPA}, a subsidiary of Copa Holdings, S.A. and member of the Star Alliance global airline network, has announced new service to Rosario, Argentina, beginning July 1, 2016, with four weekly flights from Panama City, Panama. The addition of Rosario strengthens Argentina’s connectivity with the rest of the continent, airline officials say.

<p>“Copa Airlines has offered service to Argentina for more than 16 years. We are particularly proud to announce Rosario as the latest addition to our route network, which will enhance Argentina’s connectivity with North, South and Central America and the Caribbean through our Hub of the Americas in Panama City,” said Pedro Heilbron, CEO of Copa Airlines. “This new flight offers increased opportunities for the growth and development of local trade and tourism, and will contribute to job creation for the people of Rosario.”</p>

<p>Argentina’s third-largest city in population, Rosario is located in Santa Fe Province and is considered the Cradle of the Argentine Flag. Its National Flag Memorial commemorates the raising of the “blue and white” for the first time on the shores of the Paraná River. Rosario also is the birthplace of several well-known national figures: football (soccer) Lionel Messi, the Latin American political leader and revolutionary Ernesto Che Guevara, and painter Antonio Berni.</p>

<p>Located in the eastern central part of the country, Santa Fe Province is known for its tourist attractions including guided river tours of Rosario, beautiful beaches, lush green areas, cuisine and culture, as well as a wide range of leisure activities in the city. Rosario also is an important economic, education, finance, entertainment and agriculture center, forming part of the country’s agrarian triangle with Pergamino and Venado Tuerto.</p>

<p>Copa flight CM 805 will begin four-times-weekly service on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays, departing at 3:20 p.m. from the airline’s Hub of the Americas at Tocumen International Airport in Panama, and arriving at the Islas Maldivas International Airport in Rosario, Argentina, at 12:07 a.m. The return flight, CM 806, will depart Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays at 1:20 a.m., arriving in Panama at 6:28 a.m.</p>

<p>Passengers can connect at the Hub of the Americas to Copa’s extensive route network, including the airline’s 2 destinations in Panama, six in Mexico, three in Canada and the major cities of Central America and the Caribbean.</p>

<p>Currently Copa Airlines operates an average of 315 daily departures and arrivals through its Hub of the Americas at Tocumen International Airport, offering the most international flights of any airport in Latin America. In addition, Copa’s on-time performance of 91.69 percent recently earned the airline recognition as the “Most on-time airline in Latin America” and No. 2 in the world from London-based OAG.</p>
