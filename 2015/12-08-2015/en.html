	<p class="date-field">Panama City, Panama, Dec. 8, 2015</p>

	<p>Copa Airlines {NYSE: CPA}, subsidiary of Copa Holdings, S. A, and member of the Star Alliance global airline network, today began direct flights from the beautiful Caribbean city of Belize to the Hub of the Americas at Tocumen International Airport in Panama City, Panama, connecting the city with destinations throughout the American continent.</p>

	<p>The day was a historic occasion in the history of Panama and Belize, marking the first time that the two countries have been connected via airline service. During the ceremony for the inaugural flight, which took place in Philip S. W. Goldson International Airport in Belize, local guests celebrated the important milestone with members of the airline’s board of directors and employees.
 
<p>“Copa Airlines is proud to begin operations to this new destination,” said Pedro Heilbron, CEO of Copa Airlines. “We now offer service to every country in Central America, increasing connectivity from Panama’s Hub of the Americas and strengthening our leadership in the region. We expect our Belize fight to generate opportunities for development of the city’s’ business and tourism sectors through improvement of the country’s connections to the rest of Latin America.”</p>

<p>Belize City offers visitors a wide variety of tourist attractions. On the Caribbean Sea, the country offers a diversity of islands and keys with crystal-clear waters and white sands. Belize is considered a SCUBA divers’ paradise, with impressive underwater sites such as the famous “Great Blue Hole,” which reaches a depth of 145 meters, and the largest coral barrier reef in the Western hemisphere.</p>

<p>This Central American country reflects its Mayan influences: the Cayo District in the western part of the country, important archeological sites such as the Xunantuhich ruins, the twin cities of Santa Elena and San Ignacio, among other Mayan cities. The country’s well-known tourist attractions include the San Juan Cathedral, the Government House, the Yarborough Cemetery, the Swing Bridge and the Marine Terminal.</p>

<p>"I must reiterate how important this partnership is, as COPA will not only supply significant potential markets for Belize, but also offer excellent and competitive linkages to the Caribbean, Central and especially to the South American market. Currently, the latter represents less than 5% of overnight tourist arrivals to Belize, with the biggest barrier being limited accessibility. As a result, and in keeping with our initiation of strategic and targeted marketing efforts in South America, this partnership could not come at a more opportune time". Hon. Minister Manuel Heredia</p>

<p>From the Hub of the Americas, in Panama City, Copa Airlines offers flights to more international destinations than any other airline with a hub in the Caribbean, Central or South America. The flight between Belize and Panama is timed for convenient connections to Sao Paulo, Brazil; San Jose, Costa Rica; Bogotá, Cartagena and Medellin, Colombia; Santiago, Chile; Quito and Guayaquil, Ecuador; Managua, Nicaragua; Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago; Havana, Cuba; Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic; and Lima, Peru. Connecting passengers do not have to make immigration or customs stops and baggage is checked to the final destination.</p>

<p>Copa flight CM 281 will depart Belize City twice weekly on Tuesdays and Fridays at 2:07 p.m., arriving at the Hub of the Americas at Tocumen International Airport in Panama City at 5:23 p.m. The Panama-Belize flight, CM 280, will depart Panama on Tuesdays and Fridays at 11:27 a.m., arriving in Belize at 12:49 p.m. All itineraries are local and the flight time is approximately 2 hours and 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Copa will operate a modern Embraer 190 aircraft on the direct flight to Belize, with seating for 94 passengers, 10 in Business Class and 84 in the main cabin. The aircraft is configured with two seats on each side of the aisle and with no middle seat, adding to passenger comfort. </p>

<p>Copa Airlines’ passengers can make rapid, convenient connections to 73 destinations in 31 countries in North, Central and South America and the Caribbean from its Hub of the Americas in Panama City, the hub with the greatest number of international connections in Latin America.
