	<p class="date-field">Panama - November, 18 2010 </p>

	<p>Boeing [NYSE: BA] and Copa Airlines [NYSE: CPA] presented today a $100,000 donation to Panama's Biomuseo to support the museum's efforts to educate national and international visitors about the importance of Panama's biodiversity and encourage environmental education.</p>

<p>"I'm delighted to share our vision of what will become one of Panama´s natural treasures," said Pilar Aleman, Secretary of the Board and Member of the Executive Committee of the Biomuseo. "This generous donation will help the museum continue building programs and exhibits that will offer a one-of-a-kind experience to visitors."</p>

<p>"Copa Airlines is one of our major sponsors and has supported the Biomuseo continuously since its inception. We are proud that through Copa we have been able to add a prestigious company such as Boeing to our family of supporters," said Alejandro Ferrer, Chairman of the Amador Foundation.</p>
 

<p>"The Boeing Company is proud to be a part of the programs that the Biomuseo will develop in a number of areas," said Van Rex Gallard, vice president of Sales for Latin America, Africa, and the Caribbean for Boeing Commercial Airplanes. "Boeing has a long history of supporting education and environmental programs around the world and this partnership enables us to do both."</p>



<p>This is not the first time Biomuseo and Panama's premier airline join forces.  In 2009, Copa Airlines sponsored Biomuseo's Human Path gallery, a partial open-air space in the museum where 16 columns will display information about the relationships between human history and Panama's natural landscapes through time. Other collaborations between the Biomuseo and Copa Airlines include Biomuseo's participation in Copa Airlines' 2009 Environmental Fair, and their joint collaboration in a 2009 Corporate Responsibility Forum carried out by the Global Compact Network.  In May 2010, Copa Airlines sponsored the first prize in Biomuseo's first Gastronomic Festival called "Biodiversity à la carte".</p>

 

<p>"Copa Airlines has been involved with the Biomuseo for many years as one of its principal corporate sponsors," said Pedro Heilbron, CEO of Copa Airlines. "We're happy we could work with Boeing to continue our support with what will be one of Panama's natural crown jewels: The Biomuseo."</p>

 

<p>The Biomuseo's mission is to provide a memorable experience that will educate people about the biodiversity of wildlife in Panama -- a result of the emergence of the Isthmus. The museum's goal is to encourage international visitors to learn about and develop an appreciation for the ecology of Panama and its environmental protection efforts. The Biomuseo, the first building designed by famed architect Frank Gehry in Latin America, is scheduled to open in 2012.</p>
